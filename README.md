This code demonstrates the concept of components in React:
MyButton acts as a reusable component for creating buttons.
MyApp is the main component that builds the overall structure of the application, using the MyButton component within it.
It showcases how components can be composed to create a more complex UI.
It uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like structures within code, making it easier to create user interfaces.
